## Deployment and Operations Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20 or higher
- Yarn package manager
- Git for version control

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd gatsby-starter-apple

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn develop

# Access the site at http://localhost:8000
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
yarn develop          # Start development server with hot reload
yarn start           # Alias for develop

# Production
yarn build           # Build for production
yarn serve           # Serve production build locally

# Code Quality
yarn lint            # Run ESLint
yarn lint:fix        # Fix ESLint issues automatically
yarn format          # Format code with Prettier
yarn typecheck       # TypeScript type checking

# Maintenance
yarn clean           # Clean Gatsby cache and public folder
```

### Environment Configuration

1. **Update Site Metadata**: Edit `gatsby-meta-config.js`
```javascript
module.exports = {
  title: "Your Blog Title",
  description: "Your blog description",
  author: "Your Name",
  siteUrl: "https://yourdomain.com",
  lang: "en",
  utterances: "username/repository-name", // For comments
  links: {
    github: "https://github.com/username/repository",
  },
  favicon: "src/images/icon.png",
}
```

2. **Content Management**: Add blog posts in `src/posts/blog/`
3. **Styling Customization**: Modify `src/styles/` files
4. **Component Updates**: Edit components in `src/components/`

### Production Deployment

#### Netlify (Recommended)
1. Connect GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Build command: `yarn build`
3. Publish directory: `public`
4. Node version: 20

#### Alternative Platforms
- **Vercel**: Zero-config deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Use gatsby-plugin-gh-pages
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Static hosting with CDN

### Content Creation Workflow

1. Create new markdown file in `src/posts/blog/`
2. Add required frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
category: "Category Name"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +09:00"
desc: "Post description"
thumbnail: "./images/folder/image.jpg"
alt: "Image alt text"
---
```
3. Write content in Markdown
4. Commit and push changes
5. Site rebuilds automatically

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: 50+ dependencies require regular updates
2. **Platform Lock-in**: Heavy Gatsby ecosystem dependency
3. **Build Complexity**: Multiple plugin interactions may cause conflicts

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Performance Regression**: Unmonitored bundle size growth
2. **Accessibility Issues**: Limited testing automation
3. **SEO Changes**: Google algorithm updates may affect visibility

### Low Priority Risks
1. **Theme Maintenance**: Custom styling may require updates
2. **Comment System Dependency**: Utterances service availability
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Modern JavaScript features usage

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)
1. **Add Testing Framework**: Implement Jest and React Testing Library
2. **Security Hardening**: Configure Dependabot for automated updates
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Integrate Web Vitals tracking
4. **Documentation**: Create detailed setup and customization guides

### Short-term Improvements (1-3 months)
1. **CMS Integration**: Consider Netlify CMS or Forestry for non-technical users
2. **Analytics Setup**: Implement Google Analytics or privacy-focused alternatives
3. **Error Tracking**: Add Sentry or similar error monitoring
4. **Accessibility Audit**: Conduct comprehensive accessibility testing

### Long-term Considerations (3-12 months)
1. **Migration Planning**: Evaluate alternatives to reduce vendor lock-in
2. **Multi-language Support**: Implement internationalization if needed
3. **Advanced Features**: Consider search functionality, newsletter integration
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement advanced caching strategies

## Conclusion

Gatsby Starter Apple represents a well-architected, production-ready blog template that balances developer experience with end-user performance. The codebase demonstrates strong engineering practices and modern web development standards. While the project has some areas for improvement, particularly in testing and monitoring, it provides an excellent foundation for content-focused websites.

The template is recommended for:
- Technical blogs and documentation sites
- Personal portfolios with blog functionality
- Small to medium-scale content websites
- Projects requiring high performance and SEO optimization

Success factors for implementation include proper environment configuration, regular dependency updates, and establishing clear content creation workflows for non-technical stakeholders.
